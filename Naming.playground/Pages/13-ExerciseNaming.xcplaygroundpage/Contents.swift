 ## Exercise: Good Names
 
 You’ve inherited some code from another programmer, who never had a chance to take the _App Development with Swift_ course. All you found was a note with the following written on it:
 
 > **Truck loading guide**
 >
 > Pallets of oranges weigh 100lbs
 >
 > Pallets of watermelons weigh 200lbs
 >
 > Have to load up the left then right of the truck and keep it as balanced as possible. How many on each side? Melons always go together.
*/


//: - experiment: Rewrite the code so that it makes sense without needing a note. Use meaningful names and comments.

let palletOranges = 14
let palletsWatermelon = 3
let orangeWeight = 100
let watermelonWeight = 200
let totalOrangeWeight = palletOranges * orangeWeight
let totalWatermelonWeight = palletsWatermelon * watermelonWeight
let totalWeight = totalOrangeWeight + totalWatermelonWeight
let weightOfeachSide = totalWeight / 2
let palletsOfOrangesPerSide = weightOfeachSide / orangeWeight
let palletsOfWatermelonPerSide = weightOfeachSide / watermelonWeight
